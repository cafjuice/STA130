But when you find yourself frustrated with a ChatBots inability to give you the results you're looking for, this is a \"hint\" that you've become overreliant on the ChatBots. Your objective should not be to have ChatBots \"do the work for you\", but to use ChatBots to help you build your understanding so you can efficiently leverage ChatBots (and other resources) to help you work more efficiently.<br><br>\n",

In this case, rather than using df.drop(na) to delete many rows (that could have all had pertinent information on variables other than fare), we would use del df.['fare'] in order to preserve more data.\n",

(In my testing, using del df['col'] after df.dropna() resulted in a KeyError for the column, since it no longer exists). In addition, del df['col'] allows the user to be more specific with what data they wish to delete, whereas df.dropna() is a more general operation that deletes ALL rows and columns with missing data, including rows that might otherwise have data points in every other variable (see: example in 7.2 with the sinking ledger)."

    "\"The `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'titanics.csv'` error occurs when Python tries to read a file, but the file is not found in the specified directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few things to check and do to resolve this issue:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Check the file path**: Ensure that the file path is correct. If the file is in the same directory as your script, just using the filename (`'titanics.csv'`) should work. Otherwise, you will need to provide the full or relative path to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "   # If the file is in the same directory\n",
    "   df = pd.read_csv('titanics.csv')\n",
    "\n",
    "   # If the file is in a different directory\n",
    "   df = pd.read_csv('/path/to/your/file/titanics.csv')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Verify the file name**: Make sure the file is named correctly and matches the string you are using in the code (`'titanics.csv'`). File names are case-sensitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Check if the file exists**: Verify that the file actually exists in the specified directory. If not, you will need to download or move it there.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Use the correct working directory**: If you're working with a script or in a notebook, check the current working directory. You can check and change it with these commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import os\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Check current working directory\n",
    "   print(os.getcwd())\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Change directory if needed\n",
    "   os.chdir('/path/to/your/directory')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "By ensuring the file path is correct and the file is present, this error should be resolved.\""

    "8.3: Overall, I found that ChatGPT was much more helpful when used as a debugging tool than Google, as ChatGPT was able to correctly identify exactly which errors I introduced in my code and point to those as the causes of my errors, instead of me having to trudge through the depths of Stack Overflow in order to identify the issue with my specific code. It even managed to correctly identify the last error's problem with writing a string as a variable, which I was very impressed by! My Google searches also tended to include specific examples of other people's code, which I was usually unable to parse due to my unfamiliarity with Python, and with the individual projects that people were requesting help with. To be honest, though, my eyes glazed over when ChatGPT started suggesting me code, and I admittedly found every answer to the \"FileNotFoundError: [Errno2] No such file or directory\" error confusing since I do not have much experience with file paths.\n",
