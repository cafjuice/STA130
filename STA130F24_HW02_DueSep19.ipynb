    "A reasonable characterization of STA130 Homework is that it simply defines a weekly reading comprehension assignment. \n",
    "Indeed, STA130 Homework essentially boils down to completing various understanding confirmation exercises oriented around coding and writing tasks.\n",
    "However, rather than reading a textbook, STA130 Homework is based on ChatBots so students can interactively follow up to clarify questions or confusion that they may still have regarding learning objective assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Communication is a fundamental skill underlying statistics and data science, so STA130 Homework based on ChatBots helps practice effective two-way communication as part of a \"realistic\" dialogue activity supporting underlying conceptual understanding building. \n",
    "\n",
    "It will likely become increasingly tempting to rely on ChatBots to \"do the work for you\". But when you find yourself frustrated with a ChatBots inability to give you the results you're looking for, this is a \"hint\" that you've become overreliant on the ChatBots. Your objective should not be to have ChatBots \"do the work for you\", but to use ChatBots to help you build your understanding so you can efficiently leverage ChatBots (and other resources) to help you work more efficiently.<br><br>\n",

    "The questions (as copy-pasted prompts) are designed to initialize appropriate ChatBot conversations which can be explored in the manner of an interactive and dynamic textbook; but, it is nonetheless **strongly recommendated** that your rephrase the questions in a way that you find natural to ensure a clear understanding of the question. Given sensible prompts the represent a question well, the two primary challenges observed to arise from ChatBots are \n",

    "1. conversations going beyond the intended scope of the material addressed by the question; and, \n",
    "2. unrecoverable confusion as a result of sequential layers logial inquiry that cannot be resolved. \n",

    "In the case of the former (1), adding constraints specifying the limits of considerations of interest tends to be helpful; whereas, the latter (2) is often the result of initial prompting that leads to poor developments in navigating the material, which are likely just best resolve by a \"hard reset\" with a new initial approach to prompting.

Of course, in doing so, a ChatBot may introduce functions that you've technically not learned or seen before; but, the amount of simplification and clarifying comments is probably going to more than compensate for this; and, you'll have seen a learned a little bit more about what's possible through this process, which is the ideal experience we're hoping you'll see here._ \n",

    "> _As you may or may not have already experienced in the previous problem, a ChatBot applied to this problem is likely to start explaining a bit more knowledge about Python than you need to know (as a student just trying to learn stats+DS); however, you'll probably feel like this \"out of scope\" context information is helpful to know (or at least be aware of) and easy to understand and learn if you use some addtional prompts to dig deeper into them. A ChatBot will be quite good at explaining and helping understand smaller chunks of code; however, if given too much information at once it can gloss over some information._\n",

    "> _That said, some topics here are potentially quite and advanced and too tricky! You might be able to ask the ChatBot to simplify its explanations and that might help a bit. But on the other hand, some topics, such as, \"how does `nested_dict = lambda: defaultdict(nested_dict)` work?\" might just simply be too advanced to really admit a simpler explanation via a ChatBot. You'll have to let these sorts of things go, if you come across explanations that just aren't improving or helping at at. In the case of `defaultdict(nested_dict)` specifically, the details here are well beyond the scope of STA130 and can be very safely ignored for now. The code will have reviewed and \"walked thorugh\" in LEC, but the perspectives espoused there will be the extent of the formal commentary and information regarding the coding topics we encounter in the Markov ChatBots code here._\n",

    "\"In this session, we focused on the **Monty Hall problem** and its simulation in Python. Here's a summary of the key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understanding the Monty Hall Problem**:\n",
    "   - The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle where switching doors after a reveal gives a 2/3 chance of winning.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Breaking Down Your Original Code**:\n",
    "   - We analyzed your initial simulation step by step, explaining how doors are selected, Monty reveals a \"goat\" door, and how the player switches doors to maximize winning chances.\n",
    "   - Key lines such as `my_door_choice = all_door_options_list[0]` were explained as implementing the switch strategy.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Simplifying the Simulation**:\n",
    "   - I suggested a more streamlined version of the code that uses list comprehensions and eliminates unnecessary steps, making the logic clearer.\n",
    "   - The simplified version uses direct list filtering and more compact handling of the switch decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Explaining Specific Code Parts**:\n",
    "   - The use of `_` in `for _ in range(reps)` was explained as a convention for ignoring loop variables.\n",
    "   - We discussed list comprehensions like `[door for door in all_door_options if door != player_choice and door != winning_door]` to filter out specific doors.\n",
    "   - The line `switched_choice = [door for door in all_door_options if door != player_choice and door != monty_reveals][0]` was broken down to show how the switch choice is made based on remaining doors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, we explored how to efficiently simulate the Monty Hall problem and optimized your approach while clarifying key Python concepts.\"\n",

    "1. **Markov Chain Chatbot Code Explanation:**\n",
    "   - We discussed a code snippet that builds a Markov model where words and their transitions to the next word are recorded.\n",

    "### Initial Questions and Clarifications:\n",
    "1. **Understanding Markov Chain Code**:\n",
    "   - We discussed the original Markov chain code, focusing on how `word_used` and `next_word` dictionaries track word frequencies and transitions.\n",
    "   - Explained how `enumerate` works in the loop (`for i, word in enumerate(words[:-1])`), where `i` is the index, and `word` is the loop variable.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Clarification on Lambda Functions**:\n",
    "   - We explored the meaning of `defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))`, where the lambda function creates a default dictionary that can automatically create nested `defaultdicts` if a key doesn’t exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extensions to the Markovian Chatbot:\n",
    "1. **Markovian Chatbot Extension #1**:\n",
    "   - This version uses **two-word sequences** (bigrams) to track word transitions, allowing for more context-aware sentence generation.\n",
    "   - We discussed how this change improves the chatbot by adding more complexity and realism to the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Markovian Chatbot Extension #2**:\n",
    "   - This extension introduces the concept of **characters** from a dataset (using a `Counter`), where each character has its own unique Markov chain for word transitions.\n",
    "   - We discussed how **nested dictionaries** are used to track two-word pairs and the next word, specific to each character.\n",
    "   - Explained the idea of **recursively creating nested dictionaries**, allowing dynamic creation of multiple levels of dictionaries to store complex hierarchical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts Discussed:\n",
    "- **Counter Objects**: Used to count occurrences of characters in the dataset.\n",
    "- **Enumerate**: How it provides both the index and the value in a loop.\n",
    "- **Recursive Nested Dictionaries**: A powerful technique to automatically create nested dictionaries without manual initialization.\"\n",

    "## ChatGPT's answer to Question 5.3:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"This code is an extension of a Markovian chatbot model, building upon the idea of predicting the next word in a sequence based on historical word usage. It also includes an additional feature that tracks characters (in a text dataset like movie scripts or conversations) and the words they tend to use. Let’s break it down:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Markovian Chatbot Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`word_used` and `next_word` dictionaries**:\n",
    "   - **`word_used`**: Keeps track of how many times each word appears in the training dataset.\n",
    "   - **`next_word`**: Tracks how frequently each word is followed by another specific word. It stores word-pair sequences, forming the basis for generating text based on probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Original Markov Chain Process**:\n",
    "- The loop iterates through `words[:-1]` (all words except the last one), looking at each word and the word that follows it (`words[i+1]`).\n",
    "  - If the current word has been seen before, it increments its count in `word_used`. If it's new, it initializes its count.\n",
    "  - Similarly, it checks if the next word (`words[i+1]`) has followed the current word before. If yes, it increments the count in `next_word`, otherwise, it initializes the pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Markovian Chatbot Extension #2**:\n",
    "This is an enhanced version of the above chatbot that includes the concept of \"characters\" in a conversation or script (like lines spoken by different people). Here’s the breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Characters with the `Counter` object**:\n",
    "   - **`characters`**: Uses the `Counter` to analyze the `character` column of the dataset `avatar`. This column is converted to uppercase, and spaces between names are replaced with periods.\n",
    "   - The dataset likely consists of dialogue, where each line is attributed to a specific character. The code ensures that all characters are standardized.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`nested_dict` Function**:\n",
    "   - **`nested_dict`**: A recursive dictionary structure that allows for the creation of dictionaries inside dictionaries automatically when needed (via `defaultdict`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`word_used2C` and `next_word2C` dictionaries**:\n",
    "   - **`word_used2C`**: Tracks how many times a character uses specific two-word sequences (bi-grams).\n",
    "   - **`next_word2C`**: Stores the words that typically follow each bi-gram spoken by a character. This structure allows tracking chains of three words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Markov Chain Process for Characters**:\n",
    "- The loop iterates through `words[:-2]`, meaning it processes words in groups of three.\n",
    "- **Character detection**:\n",
    "   - If a word matches a character's name (detected using the `characters` counter), the `character` variable is set to that name.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- **Word and Next Word Sequences**:\n",
    "   - For each character, the program tracks how many times they use a specific bi-gram (two consecutive words). This information is stored in `word_used2C[character]`.\n",
    "   - It also tracks the next word that follows each bi-gram and stores this in `next_word2C[character]`.\n",
    "   - This setup allows the model to predict the third word in a sequence for each character, providing more contextual and specific responses based on the character's speaking habits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary**:\n",
    "- **Original model**: Tracks individual words and their immediate successors (unigram + next-word probability).\n",
    "- **Extended model**: Adds context by tracking sequences of two words (bi-grams) and predicts the third word based on character-specific patterns in the dialogue.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using these bi-grams and tri-grams, the chatbot can simulate more coherent and character-specific conversations, mimicking the style and flow of each character's dialogue.\"\n",

I also remain wary of ChatGPT in particular because of how it doe not cite any of their sources of information, as opposed to NotebookLM, where the user feeds in the specific sources that they want the notebook to train on; while the information that ChatGPT has given me about the topics covered in this course thus far have been more accurate than I originally thought, I think that as I continue studying statistics, that accuracy level will start to decline."

Highlights include how ChatGPT said that effective communication can \"bridge the gap between technical experts and decision-makers\", and that not only do these skills create a well-rounded data scientist, they create a well-rounded portfolio for marketing, consulting, customer service, and even agriculture. I then asked ChatGPT whether or not someone could succeed in data science or statistics without having any previous coding or data analysis experience, to which ChatGPT essentially replied that it would be very hard, but not impossible; it gave me tips on taking online courses, keeping my programming learning focused to Python and R, and getting involved in hands-on projects to boost my portfolio. I then asked ChatGPT about whether codin and data analysis are relevant to pursuing a career in public health, and ChatGPT gave me a list of careers in public health that heavily employ data analysis skills, such as epidemiology and biostatistics, along with the skills required for me to find a position in any of those careers. It then gave me another list of key skills necessary to pursue a career in public health, which had significant overlap with the list that it gave me for key skills in statistics and data science.\n",

    "I think the most striking part of my conversation with ChatGPT was how it felt like the Chatbot kept repeating similar phrases about how \"developing strong analytical thinking skills\" is a \"highly valued skill across all industries\", which is both true and a little uninspiring (one would assume this to be the case already!). I also found myself repeatedly questioning ChatGPT's biases, especially when it emphasised the importance of learning how to use AI and machine learning tools, since the future success of ChatGPT as a for-profit software depends on that assumption... I feel like I would have gotten more specific answers both through better prompting (out of all the questions I asked it, I got the best answers from asking it whether or not I could succeed in data science without a solid coding foundation) and if I talked to a professional in the field, since they could contribute their lived experience in the conversation. In regards to what I will do to pursue this conversation further (with real people this time), I signed up for the Health Studies mentorship program, which, along with the Statistics mentorship, will hopefully help me navigate my future career path better than ChatGPT has thus far, haha."
